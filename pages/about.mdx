# About Project

## TL:DR - Developer Log

In my experience the best way to get properly acquainted with new technologies is to build something to from idea to “deployed”. You just never know how different technologies will interact until trying to get something to \*production. My little letter scrambler from 2017 was a trivial yet useful project to I still use to generate usernames.

It was the perfect low complexity project to focus on exploring how Next.js, TypeScript and ChakraUi interact together.

This project resulted in an enhancement of React Typescript patterns to production level. A significant build out of boilerplate for Next, TS, Chakra projects, with strong theme support, dark/light mode, strong content styling with MDX (markdown).

### TL:DR - History Of Original Letter Scramble Project

The original [reorder-string - codepen](https://codepen.io/LucasZapico/pen/wvMqqwO) was meant as both a practice project in vanillajs and to solve my lack of ability to come up with "good" usernames.

To solve this conundrum I came up with the \*brilliant notion to just randomize my name. Not a perfect solution but one that is a good enough so I can put my brain onto other things.

> Better than a band-aid but not going to win any awards. 🤷‍♂️
